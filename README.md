This website represents one of my first few attempts at anything HTML/CSS related. It was born from boredom on a few hot summer days. If you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know at priyankan [at] u.northwestern.edu (I'm trying to get better at this stuff!).

I used the Minimal theme.
