Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in [computer science and communication](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/") at Northwestern University, where I'm part of the [Midwest Uncertainty Collective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/) and advised by Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). My research is in human-computer interaction. <mark>I'm interested in creating tools that help people reason about algorithms---particularly the societal implications of different parameter values.</mark> Specifically, I've spent much of the past few years thinking about how various interested parties reason about differential privacy, including in the context of the 2020 U.S. Census. 

During my PhD, I have been supported by an Advanced Cognitive Science Fellowship and a Data Science Fellowship. I have also been a visiting PhD student at Columbia University, advised by Professors [Rachel Cummings](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cummings), [Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), and [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/). I've also interned at Microsoft Research, where I was mentored by Drs. [Jenn Wortman Vaughan](http://www.jennwv.com/) and [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/).

During the academic year, I co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). We read books that help us think critically about technology and media. Please reach out if interested in joining!
