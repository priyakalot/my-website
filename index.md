Hi! I'm a PhD student in a dual program in [computer science and communication](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/") at Northwestern University. My advisor is Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). I'm interested in studying 1) how algorithms can be more effectively implemented and 2) their downstream consequences. Lately, I have been thinking about the social challenges arising around the U.S. Census Bureau's adoption of differential privacy.

I also co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). We read books that help us think critically about technology and media.

<span style="color:red">During Spring 2022, I am a visiting PhD student at Columbia University working under the guidance of Professors [Rachel Cummings](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cummings), [Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), and [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/) on explaining differential privacy to end users.</span>
