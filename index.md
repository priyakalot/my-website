Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in [computer science and communication](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/") at Northwestern University, where I'm part of the [Midwest Uncertainty Collective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/) and advised by Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). During Fall 2022 (<mark>now!</mark>), I'm a visiting graduate student in the [Data-Driven Decision Processes](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/datadriven2022) program at Simons Institute, UC Berkeley.

My research is in human-computer interaction. <mark>I create tools that map algorithmic components to real-world outcomes</mark> to help people make more informed decisions around the implementation or use of algorithms. Specifically, I've spent much of the past few years thinking about how various interested parties reason about differential privacy, including in the context of the 2020 U.S. Census.

During my PhD, I have been supported by an Advanced Cognitive Science Fellowship and a Data Science Fellowship. I have also been a visiting PhD student at Columbia University, advised by Professors [Rachel Cummings](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cummings), [Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), and [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/). I've also interned at Microsoft Research, where I was mentored by Drs. [Jenn Wortman Vaughan](http://www.jennwv.com/) and [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/).

During the academic year, I co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). We read books that help us think critically about technology and media. Please reach out if interested in joining!
