> **_Update:_** Starting Fall 2024, I will be a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University as part of the <a href="https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Research on Computation and Society</a>.

Hi! I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">computer science and communication</a> at Northwestern University, where I am part of the <a href="https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Midwest Uncertainty Collective</a> and advised by Professor <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/" target="_blank">Jessica Hullman</a>. My research is at the intersection of <mark>privacy</mark> and <mark>visualization</mark>. In general, I am interested in problems where <a href="https://priyakalot.github.io/papers/Whats_Driving_Conflicts_Around_Differential_Privacy_for_the_U.S._Census.pdf" target="_blank">technology and society meet</a>, and where effectively using a technology requires grappling with hard social questions.

Rapidly increasing amounts of data can power extraordinary progress, but can also be a source of considerable harm if misdirected. I create tools that help society proactively direct data flows: which flows should we amplify vs. restrict to attain data's benefits while mitigating harms? My work facilitates reasoning around this question in the context of data analysis. Specifically, I design and evaluate interactive interfaces and other abstractions that <i>make differential privacy usable</i>. These tools support people across the data ecosystem—data curators, analysts, and subjects—in weighing value-laden, probabilistic tradeoffs to decide how much “privacy loss” about an individual is appropriate during an analysis. 

During my PhD, I have been supported by an Advanced Cognitive Science Fellowship and a Data Science Fellowship. I have also been a visiting PhD student at Columbia University, advised by Professors <a href="https://rachelcummings.com/" target="_blank">Rachel Cummings</a>, <a href="https://elissaredmiles.com/" target="_blank">Elissa M. Redmiles</a>, and <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/" target="_blank">Gabriel Kaptchuk</a>, and a visiting graduate student in the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/datadriven2022" target="_blank">Data-Driven Decision Processes</a> program at Simons Institute, UC Berkeley. I've also interned at Microsoft Research, where I was mentored by Drs. <a href="http://www.jennwv.com/" target="_blank">Jenn Wortman Vaughan</a> and <a href="http://dirichlet.net/" target="_blank">Hanna Wallach</a>.

A while back, I co-founded HCI+D's <a href="https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html" target="_blank">PhD Book Club</a>. It's a wonderful group that critically examines media and techology; please reach out to one of the current organizers if you're interested in joining!
