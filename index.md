Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in [computer science and communication](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/") at Northwestern University, where I'm part of the [Midwest Uncertainty Collective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/) and advised by Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). My research is at the intersection of <b>privacy</b> and <b>visualization</b>. In general, I am interested in problems where [technology and society meet](https://priyakalot.github.io/papers/Whats_Driving_Conflicts_Around_Differential_Privacy_for_the_U.S._Census.pdf), and where effectively using a technology requires grappling with hard social questions.

I create tools that help society make decisions about data flows: which flows should we amplify vs. restrict to attain data’s benefits while avoiding harms? My work facilitates reasoning around this question in the context of statistical analysis. Specifically, I design and evaluate interactive interfaces and other abstractions that <i>make differential privacy usable</i>. These tools support people across the data ecosystem—data curators, analysts, and subjects—in weighing value-laden, probabilistic tradeoffs to decide how much “privacy loss” about an individual is appropriate during an analysis. 

During my PhD, I have been supported by an Advanced Cognitive Science Fellowship and a Data Science Fellowship. I have also been a visiting PhD student at Columbia University, advised by Professors [Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com/), [Elissa M. Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), and [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/), and a visiting graduate student in the [Data-Driven Decision Processes](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/datadriven2022) program at Simons Institute, UC Berkeley. I've also interned at Microsoft Research, where I was mentored by Drs. [Jenn Wortman Vaughan](http://www.jennwv.com/) and [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/).

I co-founded and co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). During the academic year, we read books that help us think critically about technology and media. Please reach out if interested in joining!
