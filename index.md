Hi! I'm a PhD student in [Technology and Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/"), a joint program in computer science and communication studies, at Northwestern University. My advisor is Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). My current research is on facilitating reasoning around the implementation of differentially private algorithms (more info [here](https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/graduate/fellowships/fellowship-winners.html)). Lately, I have also been thinking about how computer science researchers consider the downstream consequences of their work. I completed my master's degree in information studies at the University of Amsterdam and my bachelor's degree in statistics at UCLA.
