Hi! I'm an incoming PhD student in [Technology and Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/"), a joint program in computer science and communication studies, at Northwestern University. I am interested in ways that data can be made more accessible and interpretable to the public. I completed my master's degree in information studies at the University of Amsterdam and my bachelor's degree in statistics at UCLA.

The photo to the left was taken at the [Museumplein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumplein "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumplein"), at the corner closest to the Stedelijk Museum.
