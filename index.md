Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in [computer science and communication](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/") at Northwestern University. My advisor is Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). Through my research, <mark>I create tools for engaging a wide range of stakeholders in reasoning about societal tradeoffs implicated by algorithmic systems</mark>. Specifically, I've spent much of the past few years thinking about how various stakeholders reason about differential privacy, including in the context of the 2020 U.S. Census. 

During my PhD, I have been supported by an Advanced Cognitive Science Fellowship and a Data Science Fellowship. I have also been a visiting PhD student at Columbia University, advised by Professors [Rachel Cummings](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cummings), [Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), and [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/). During Summer 2022 <mark>(now!)</mark>, I'm interning at Microsoft Research, where my mentors are Drs. [Jenn Wortman Vaughan](http://www.jennwv.com/) and [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/).

I also co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). We read books that help us think critically about technology and media. Please reach out if interested in joining!
