Hi! I'm a PhD student in [Technology and Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/"), a joint program in computer science and communication studies, at Northwestern University. My advisor is Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). My current research is on facilitating reasoning around the implementation of differentially private algorithms. Lately, I have also been thinking about how computer science researchers consider the downstream consequences of their work. I completed my master's degree in information studies at the University of Amsterdam and my bachelor's degree in statistics at UCLA.

I also co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). We read books that help us think critically about technology and media.
