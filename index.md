Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in a dual program in [computer science and communication](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/ "https://tsb.northwestern.edu/") at Northwestern University. My advisor is Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). I’m interested in engaging a wide range of stakeholders in setting algorithm parameters that directly map to societal trade-offs. Lately, I’ve been studying how various stakeholder groups reason about trade-offs (e.g., between accuracy and privacy) related to the U.S. Census Bureau’s adoption of differential privacy.

I also co-organize HCI+D's [PhD Book Club](https://hci.northwestern.edu/news-events/phd-book-club.html). We read books that help us think critically about technology and media.

<span style="color:red">During Spring 2022, I am a visiting PhD student at Columbia University working under the guidance of Professors [Rachel Cummings](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/rachel-cummings), [Elissa Redmiles](https://elissaredmiles.com/), and [Gabriel Kaptchuk](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/) on effectively communicating differential privacy guarantees to end users.</span>

<span style="color:red">This coming summer, I will be interning at Microsoft Research under the guidance of Drs. [Jenn Wortman Vaughan](http://www.jennwv.com/) and [Hanna Wallach](http://dirichlet.net/).</span>
